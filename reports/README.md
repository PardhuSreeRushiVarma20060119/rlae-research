# 📄 Research Reports

This directory contains formal progress reports and experimental summaries for the RLAE & SVAR research.

## Purpose

These reports synthesize raw logs from the `logs/` directory into high-level technical findings, providing mathematical formalization of:

1. **Frozen Core Invariance** (via Structural Invariance Score)
2. **Modular Specialization** (via SFT Environment Mounting)
3. **Preference Alignment** (via DPO Reward Margins)
