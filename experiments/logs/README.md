# 📊 Logs Directory

This directory serves as the repository for all outcome-level telemetry, memory statistics, and research results generated during experimental runs.

## Key Log Files

- **`exp1_results.json`**: JSON-lines file containing the outcome values and samples for Experiment 1 (Baseline, SFT, RL, and Post-Reset).
- **`exp2_results.json`**: Results from the RLAE structural elimination/thinning tests.
- **`exp3_results.json`**: Data from the SVAR structural perturbation analysis.
- **`stress_results.json`**: Cumulative data from iterative stress testing.

## Telemetry Tracked

Each record in these logs typically includes:

- `run_id`: The specific phase or experiment name.
- `prompt_id`: ID of the prompt used.
- `output_text`: The raw text generated by the model.
- `embedding`: The averaged hidden-state vector (for drift analysis).
- `entropy`: Token distribution entropy.
- `kl_divergence`: Distance from baseline (SVAR/RLAE only).
- `memory_usage_mb`: VRAM consumption during inference.
- `timestamp`: Precise epoch time.
