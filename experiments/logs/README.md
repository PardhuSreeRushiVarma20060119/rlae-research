# 📊 Logs Directory

This directory serves as the repository for all outcome-level telemetry, memory statistics, and research results generated during experimental runs.

## Log Structure

Telemetry is organized by experimental epoch:

- **`Sprint-1/`**: Initial prototyping and RLAE integration, SFT/RL operational runs.
- **`Sprint-2/`**: Baseline Weight Mutation & RLAE Method runs.
- **`Sprint-3/`**: **M1 Verification** (Repeatability Proof via Seed 1337).
- **`Sprint-4/`**: **M2 Verification** (No-Op Control & Metric Grounding).

## Key Log Files

- **`exp1_results.json`**: Outcome values for Experiment 1 (Baseline, SFT, RL, Post-Reset).
- **`exp2_results.json`**: RLAE structural elimination analysis.
- **`exp3_results.json`**: SVAR structural perturbation data.
- **`exp5_comparison_results.json`**: The **Canonical Validation Log**. Contains the KL divergence and Recoverability Factor metrics used to prove M1 (Repeatability) and M2 (Grounding).
- **`stress_results.json`**: Cumulative autonomous stress testing data.

## Telemetry Tracked

Each record in these logs typically includes:

- `run_id`: The specific phase or experiment name.
- `prompt_id`: ID of the prompt used.
- `output_text`: The raw text generated by the model.
- `embedding`: The averaged hidden-state vector (for drift analysis).
- `entropy`: Token distribution entropy.
- `kl_divergence`: Distance from baseline (SVAR/RLAE only).
- `memory_usage_mb`: VRAM consumption during inference.
- `timestamp`: Precise epoch time.
