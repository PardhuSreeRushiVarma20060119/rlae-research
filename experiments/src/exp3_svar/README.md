# 🌀 Experiment 3: SVAR (Structural Variance Analysis)

This phase applies structural boundary tests directly to the behavioral manifold to evaluate outcome-level repeatability margins.

## Perturbation Protocols

- **Weight Decay**: ε-bounded reduction of adapter influence.
- **Structural Gaussian Injection**: Inducing variance into LoRA ranks for sensitivity analysis.
- **Adversarial Latent Stress**: Probing intermediary structural latents to quantify structural covariance.

## Key Script

- **`perturbation.py`**: Orchestrates structural stressors and logs the resulting outcome-level variance.
